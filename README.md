# CommuneAppointmentAPI
#Here is my Git Hub repo liink which directly navigates you into my repo: https://github.com/SonaliMishra111/CommuneAppointmentAPI
#Now you can download the files and place it ina folder in your desktop.

#If you are using Git hub then you can also download the project by:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Commune-Appointment-System.git  
cd Commune-Appointment-System 

#If you have Java, then you can compile the code and run the program by:
javac CommuneAppointmentAPI.java  
java CommuneAppointmentAPI  

#If you donot have Java then you can run the program in any of the online java compiler.

#What you can do with this API?
1.Book an appointment (Enter the service type, name, and appointment time).
2.View all your appointments (Here you can see everything you’ve scheduled).
3.Check a specific appointment (Here you can find your appointment using its ID).
4.Get a reminder few minutes before your appointment starts.

#If I would have more time, I would have created a database to store all appointments permanently, so they don’t disappear when the system stops running.I would also have made the system dynamic, allowing users to update, cancel, or reschedule appointments in real-time instead of handling everything manually to make it more efficient and user-friendly.
